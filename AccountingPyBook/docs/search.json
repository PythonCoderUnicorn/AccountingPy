    "text": "This is a book created from a variety of Accounting textbooks used in a University degree. The goal is to make this book an all in one resource on Accounting main concepts while teaching how to use the programming language of Python to make the various accounting calculations faster and iteratively.\nMany accounting calculations are repetitive and usually one calculation ties into another calculation, which makes it very suitable for using functions that use already calculated output. Typically the Accounting world uses Microsoft Excel or proprietary software such as SAS or SPSS or others, while Python is free to use and learning the Python language is very much a valuable skill.\nOften you have accounting information stored in .xlsx files or pdf files, none of which are reproducible when you pass to a colleague or classmate. Mistakes are easy to make when working with Excel sheets, one cell can have a function but that cell’s function is not obvious and errors can happen if that cell gets altered. In Python, you can take in a xlsx or pdf file, read the data from it and run your functions to make calculations and then make a dashboard, a presentation or a web app that anyone can just go to the url and use the app.\nBy learning Python you are learning how to be more efficient with your accounting, as you write one function to calculate cost of goods sold, then you can just use that same function a million times. That function can live in one file somewhere on your computer and you can call (import) it into the current running file and still get the output you want.\nThis book will show how to make use of Python’s data objects that store data and place these into function to make our calculations repeatable. This book is a companion to the YouTube channel AccountingPy."

(net earnings, profit)\nInternal users - internal accounting information manage companies, non-profits and government organizations, help these organizations make decisions required to run the company.\nExternal users - do not have access to internal accounting information, the general public.\nPrimary users:\n\ninvestors : use accounting information to make decisions to buy, hold, or sell their ownership shares\nlenders: use accounting information to evaluate the risks of lending money\ncreditors: use accounting information to decide whether or not to grant credit to a customer\n\nProprietorship - a business owned by one person, (sole proprietorship)\nreporting entity concept - the separation of business and personal records of economic activity, to be distinct from activities of the owner and all other economic entities.\nPartnerships - a business owned by more than one person\nCorporations - a business organized as a separate legal entity owned by shareholders and is the most complex form of business to establish.\nPublic corporations - corporations that share their shares/stocks on the Stock Exchange, and are required to distribute their financial statements to investors, lenders, creditors and the public every three months.\nSEDAR - system for electronic document analysis and retrieval, financial statement website for Canadian public corporations\nPrivate corporations - corporations that issue shares but they do not make them public, nor are the shares traded on the Stock Exchange.\nGAAP - generally accepted accounting principles, which are rules,practices, procedures for recording and reporting economic events.\nIFRS - public traded corporations must use the international financial reporting standards\nASPE - for private corporations must use accounting standards for private enterprises\nbusiness activities = financing (money to expand operations), investing (building, renovations, purchasing) and operating (activities that finance company)\n\nFinancial activities\nCapital (money) is required to start any business.

This is an asset as they represent an economic resource (cash) and will be eventually collected.\n\nsupplies are short term assets used in daily operations\ninventory are items held for future sale to customers. When items are sold, they become an expense\n\nThe cost of inventory sold is an expense called cost of goods sold.\n\nexpenses are decreases in economic resources\nother names for expenses = cost of sales, selling operating and administrative expenses, and income tax expense.\n\naccounts payable - short term liability from some expenses when a company purchases inventory or supplies on credit from suppliers.\ninterest payable - the outstanding (unpaid) liability amounts owed to various lenders and creditors\n\ndividends payable, salaries payable, property payable, sales tax payable\n\nBusiness goal is to sell a good or service for a price greater than the cost of producing or purchasing the good or providing the service, plus the cost of operating the business.\nnet income - revenues are greater than the expenses incurred to generate the revenues.

The ownership interest in a company is known as shareholder’s equity, which is the total shareholder’s equity including:\n\nshare capital : the amounts contributed by the shareholders in exchange for shares of ownership\nretained earnings\nother accounts\n\ncommon shares (end of period) = common shares (begin of period) + common shares issued (sold) - common shares repurchased\nretained earnings - the cumulative amounts of net income that have been retained in the corporation (not distributed as dividends to shareholders). If retained earnings is negative that is net loesses have exceeded net income (deficit)"
